// It's important to have proper hyperlinks in the site, because they make the
// web the web. If links aren't created correctly, there's no web.
// Some common mistakes:
// - Hash:     A hash can point to an anchor within the same page. Don't abuse it
//             by putting it in an <a> that acts as a <button>
// - Hashbang: Made famous by Twitter, the hashbang is/was used in some One Page
//             Apps for navigational purposes. In an Progressively Enhanced site
//             it is considered an anit-pattern
